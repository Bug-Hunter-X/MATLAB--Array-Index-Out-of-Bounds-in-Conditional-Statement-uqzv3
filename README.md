This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to array indexing within a conditional statement. The error occurs when an attempt is made to access an array element using an index that is beyond the array's dimensions.  This specific scenario arises when the array size is dependent on input conditions.  The `bug.m` file illustrates the error, and `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version demonstrating how to prevent this issue through proper input validation and bounds checking.
